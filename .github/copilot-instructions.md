# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This repository currently contains minimal content. The only file present is `Test_github.md` at the root. There are no source code files, build scripts, or configuration files detected.

## Key Guidelines
- **No codebase structure yet:** There are no major components, services, or data flows to document at this time.
- **No build/test workflows:** No build, test, or debug commands are present. If you add code, document any new workflows here.
- **No project-specific conventions:** No custom patterns or conventions are established yet. Use standard best practices for new code.
- **No integrations or dependencies:** No external dependencies or integration points are defined.

## How to Extend
- When adding new files or directories, update this file to describe:
  - The purpose and structure of new components
  - Any new workflows (build, test, run, etc.)
  - Project-specific conventions or patterns
  - Integration points or dependencies
- Reference key files and directories as the project grows.

## Example Section (to update as project evolves)
```
# Example: Adding a Python module
- Place source code in `src/`
- Add tests in `tests/`
- Document new workflows in this file
```
